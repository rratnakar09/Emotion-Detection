# Facial Expression Recognition
Detecting emotions using OpenCv and Deep Learning

Performed the classification using convolution neural network(CNN). The model is able to predict the class label of an facial expression image. After 200 epochs model is able to achieve training accuracy: 0.9746 and val_accuracy: 0.5940.

Future Work: I will try to improve validation accuracy by using data agumentation and using pre trained model like ImageNet.
