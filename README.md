# Facial Expression Recognition
Detecting emotions using OpenCv and Deep Learning

Performed the classification using convolution neural network(CNN). The model is able to predict the class label of an facial expression image. I have used kaggle plateform to train this model. After 200 epochs model is able to achieve training accuracy: 0.9746 and val_accuracy: 0.5940.

First run emotion_detection_using_cnn.ipynb -> emotion_recognition_tester.ipynb</br>
Copy the trained model(emotion_det_cnn.json) and weights(emotion_det_cnn.h5) and run this emotion_recognition_tester.ipynb.

Future Work: I will try to improve validation accuracy by using data agumentation and using pre trained model like ImageNet.
